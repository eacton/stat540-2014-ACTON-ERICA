R Markdown: So Fun
==============================
#So fun
##So, so fun
###So, so, so fun

Today is a beautiful day to learn R Markdown.  You can do things you can do in a word document like *italics* or _italics_ and __bold__ or **bold**.

> You can also make pretty blockquote segments of text. You can have equations in the text.  ~~I would like to own `r 2+2` llamas~~.

That is a lie, I would really like to own...
----------------------------------------------
```{r}
library(knitr)
library(rmarkdown)
library(markdown)
2^10 
x <- 2^10
```
llamas.

##Capybaras are also awesome!

Other animals I like.

1. pikas  
2. rodents in general    
    +guinea pigs  
    +hamsters
    

Code is evaluated.
```{r code and plot}
happiness <- 1:5
llamas <- c(1,100,50,10,20)
plot(happiness, llamas, type="l")
```

Oops! forgot title!
Don't have to copy and paste images! Just change and knit.
```{r code and plot revised}
happiness <- 1:5
llamas <- c(1,100,50,10,20)
plot(happiness, llamas, type="l", main="Perfect number of llamas for absolute happiness?")
```

But if you just want to show the output of the code:
```{r plot only, echo=FALSE}
happiness <- 1:5
llamas <- c(1,100,50,10,20)
plot(happiness, llamas, type="l", main="Perfect number of llamas for absolute happiness?")
```

Or just show the code:
```{r code only, eval=FALSE}

happiness <- 1:5
llamas <- c(1,100,50,10,20)
plot(happiness, llamas, type="l", main="Perfect number of llamas for absolute happiness?")
```


>You can also put these up on github! Automatically rendered, and can also see the raw code.

Publishing... ie. RPubs

Can make pdfs!

Can include urls:

Or a descriptive link:

[R Study Group](https://github.com/minisciencegirl/studyGroup)

You can include pictures!

![llamas](llamas.jpg)

You can make tables...

Llamas|Alpacas
-----|------
better underbites|better haircuts


Future chunks dependent on previous chunks.
dep_prev()
```{r}
x
```

To generate a document without previewing it first:
render("Rmd demo.Rmd", "pdf_document")

There are also templates!
